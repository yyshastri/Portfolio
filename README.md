# Portfolio
This folder has exemplars of my data analysis skills including my publications and graphs/images based on my research. This folder also includes data from my hobby projects mostly around historical cartography and statistical data from British rule in India.

The different elements of the folder are organized in the following order: the research outputs (peer-reviewed publications) and associated graphs/figures take priority while the hobby projects which include graphs/maps are slotted in after the published research outputs.

Below is a list of the files with a brief description of each:

## Examples of Research Outputs

**1. [Spearheading Agile- The Role of the Scrum Master in Agile Projects](https://github.com/yyshastri/Portfolio/blob/6d3b3fc4033fda59dcbf93391c15e48dc9b51b86/Spearheading%20agile%20the%20role%20of%20the%20scrum%20master%20in%20Agile%20Projects.pdf):** This paper presented for the first time a multifaceted study of the multiple dimensions of the scrum master's role in Agile Software Development (ASD). The scrum master is envisioned in agile literature as the “servant leader” who serves the team in a multitude of different ways, which include promoting scrum, facilitating the team’s functioning, and removing obstacles. However, there was a lack of empirical studies which looked at the scrum master's role. This study filled an important gap in the knowledge base on ASD. The study was Mixed Methods (MM) which synthesized qualitative and quantitative data derived from interviews and surveys.

**2. [The Role of the Project Manager in Agile Software Development Projects](https://github.com/yyshastri/Portfolio/blob/b04dc9dbe402a26f807232bff6e1ffa8bbc1eae4/The%20Role%20of%20the%20Project%20Manager%20in%20Agile%20Software%20Development%20Projects.pdf):** This paper presented the results of a study on the role of project managers in ASD projects. This study was a Mixed Methods study as well and used a combination to surveys and interviews for data collection. This study was unique as it presented different aspects of the project manager’s role such as the informal activities, the management approaches adopted on a day-to-day basis and their influence on Agile practices used by the team. The version uploaded here is a pre-print one and the final published version can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.110871).

**3. [A mind map visualisation of the six informal roles played by the Agile Manager](https://github.com/yyshastri/Portfolio/blob/04048a41416b81cf243036f10287391429f86587/Mindmap%20of%20roles%20of%20agile%20manager.png):** This mind map is a shorthand visualization of some of the key findings of my PhD research, which was a study of the different roles in Agile Software Development (ASD) projects. The visualisation presents the six informal and spontaneous roles played by the manager (Mentor, Facilitator, Negotiator, Coordinator, Protector, and Process Adapter) with the key activities performed as part of each informal role.

**4. [Change in how often an Agile practice is used by the team](https://github.com/yyshastri/Portfolio/blob/04048a41416b81cf243036f10287391429f86587/Change_in_frequency_of_agile_practice.png):** This visualisation is based on quantitative data gathered via surveys from software professionals.While it does not imply correlation it does suggest that there can be a relationship between the presence of the formal titles (project manager,scrum master, and product owner) and how frequently an agile practice is used. A positive  value,coded in green in the figure, indicates that the frequency of a practice goes up when,say a project manager, is present. Similarly, a negative value, coded in green, indicates that the frequency of a practice goes down when a formal title is present.

**5. [Example of a Radar Chart based on Qualitative data](https://github.com/yyshastri/Portfolio/blob/2e63b5e9dc9c8276b04c0f522e25f70347a44673/Radar_chart_project_manager_informal_roles_agile.JPG):** This radar chart from my PhD research is a quantiative visualisation of underlying qualitative data. It shows what percentage of project managers in the study performed a particular informal role (Mentor, Facilitator, Negotiator, Coordinator, Protector, and Process Adapter).
