# Portfolio
This folder has exemplars of my data analysis skills including my publications and graphs/images based on my research. This folder also includes data from my hobby projects mostly around historical cartography and statistical data from the British rule in india.

The different elements of the folder are orgnized in the following order: the research outputs ( peer-reviewed publications) and associated graphs/figures take priority while the hobby projects which include graphs/maps are slotted in after the published research outputs. 

Below is a list of the files with a breif description of each:

**1. [Spearheading Agile- The Role of the Scrum Master in Agile Projects](Portfolio/Spearheading agile the role of the scrum master in Agile Projects.pdf)!:** This paper presented for the first time a multifaceted study of the multiple dimensions of the scrum master's role in Agile Software Development (ASD). The scrum master is envisioned in agile literature as the “servant leader” who serves the team in a multitude of different ways, which include promoting scrum, facilitating the team’s functioning, and removing obstacles. However, there was a lack of empirical studies which looked at the Scrum Master's role. This study filled an important gap in the knowledge base on ASD. The study was Mixed Methods (MM) which synthesised qualitative and quantiative data derived from interviews and surveys.
